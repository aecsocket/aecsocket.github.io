# Paper

Include the `ignacio-paper` module in your build, and use `...ignacio.paper.IgnacioAPI` to access an instance
of the `Ignacio` plugin. From there, access the `engine` property to get the `IgnacioEngine` for the server.

See the [Platforms](./README.md) page for more info.

## Versions

The plugin is only available for the latest version of the game.

The plugin has full support for [Folia](https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia).
