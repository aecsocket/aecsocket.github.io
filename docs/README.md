# Hi

I'm a hobbyist programmer from the UK, who programs in:
- Java and Kotlin - experienced
- Rust - beginner
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Python - familiarity

Some of my projects:

## [Rattle](https://github.com/aecsocket/rattle)

*(formerly Ignacio)*

![Rattle screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aecsocket/rattle/main/static/banner.png)

An integration of a 3D rigid body physics engine into a Minecraft server-side environment,
allowing simulating physics without requiring clients to download any mods.

This project taught me:
- interacting with a physics engine: rigid bodies, constraints and joints, broad/narrow phase
- creating bindings for native libraries to Java: combining C++/Rust with the JVM

## [Sokol](https://github.com/aecsocket/sokol)

![Sokol screenshot showing a decomposed pistol](/img/sokol.png)

An implementation of an entity-component-system framework into Minecraft, which allows server owners
to configure their own items using a composable structure.

This project taught me:
- working with server internals to improve performance
- creating a scalable and maintainable framework
- simple 3D modelling skills for the physical items in the world

### Examples

Attaching and detaching components on a part tree:

## [Glossa](https://github.com/aecsocket/glossa)

A simple and opinionated localization library for Adventure text components, with
features for specialized translation features like plurals, number and date formatting.

This project taught me:
- designing an approachable and stable API
- publishing a Java library to Maven Central
